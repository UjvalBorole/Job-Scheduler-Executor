1. Restart Your Existing Jenkins
# Start the existing container (if stopped)
docker start 5bb5dedfb1ed

# Or if you want the full name:
docker start jenkins

2.Clean Up and Recreate (If Needed)
# Stop and remove the old container (keeps your data in the volume)
docker stop jenkins && docker rm jenkins

# Create a fresh container with the same volume
docker run -d --name jenkins \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  -u root \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts




  It looks like you're encountering multiple issues when trying to install Docker CLI inside your Jenkins container. Let's simplify this and use a more reliable approach.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The errors suggest the container may not have `dpkg` or `lsb_release` commands available
2. The line continuation characters (`\`) aren't being processed correctly in your PowerShell environment
3. The container might not be Debian-based as expected

### Working Solution:

#### Method 1: Directly Enter Container and Install
1. First, enter the container interactively:
```powershell
docker exec -it -u root jenkins_compose /bin/bash
```

2. Once inside, run these commands:
```bash
# First check what OS we're dealing with
cat /etc/os-release

# For Debian/Ubuntu-based containers:
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker.io

# For Alpine-based containers:
apk add docker-cli

# For other distros, try:
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

#### Method 2: One-Liner for Windows PowerShell
```powershell
docker exec -u root jenkins_compose sh -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker.io || apk add docker-cli || (curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh)"
```

#### Method 3: Rebuild with Docker CLI Included
Create a Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker.io
USER jenkins
```

Then build and run:
```powershell
docker build -t jenkins-with-docker .
docker run -d --name jenkins_compose `
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home `
  -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 `
  jenkins-with-docker
```

### Verification:
```powershell
docker exec jenkins_compose docker --version
```

### Key Points:
1. Using `docker.io` package is often simpler than Docker's official packages
2. The `sh -c` approach avoids PowerShell's line continuation issues
3. If all fails, rebuilding the image with Docker included is most reliable
4. Remember you need to bind-mount the Docker socket for it to work:
   ```powershell
   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
   ```

Let me know if you still encounter issues and I can provide more targeted solutions based on your container's OS.
